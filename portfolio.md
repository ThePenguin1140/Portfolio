2. #### Remsoft

During my time at the University of New Brunswick I participated in a variety of projects. One of the more exciting ones was a contract with Remsoft Systems to design novel information visualization techniques. During this project I was responsible for the design and evaluation of several novel information visualization techniques in collaboration with my peers. Frequent meetings with Remsoft allowed us to apply an iterative design process and find a suitable and effective solution to their problem.

3. #### Stanley

The Stanley project is the accumulation of a self directed information visualization course at the University of New Brunswick. Naturally I was responsible for the design and development of this novel and interactive information visualization application using D3.js. The application aimed to give users the ability to explore Stanley Cup winnning hockey teams and the player trades between them.

4. #### TrackWell Systems

TrackWell systems was the result of a 2 semester final project for my undergraduate degree at the University of Prince Edward Island. The system aimed to bridge the gap between health practitioners and patients through lifestyle data collection, analysis and visualization using mobile technology. After developing our initial prototype for this course three of us decided to attempt to turn this project into a Start-up. During the summer of 2012 we continued to develop the application. However, lack of funding and experience forced us to accept more sustainable opportunities. For the complete duration of the project I assumed the position of *managing* the project which included:
 - the division of labor
 - creation and implementation of development standards:
   - code documentation
   - code styles
   - commit message standards and repository maintenance
   - user interface consistency standards

In addition to this I was also responsible for the design of the user experience and interface of the application.

5. #### DeltaWare User Experience Evaluations

While working for DeltaWare my responsibilities ranged from maintenance and development to research and usability testing. My current role revolves around the evaluation of low, medium and high fidelity prototypes using heuristic evaluations and in-house usability studies. As part of this I prepare detailed reports for management outline significant areas of improvement and emphasize the importance of user centered design. Additionally I have held several workshops and lectures on usability and user experience to developers and management to help the integration of user centered design.
